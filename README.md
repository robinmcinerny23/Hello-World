# Hello-World
BAsic Tutorial on how to use this.
I'm very new to programming
Like I can follow directions and that's about it.
I'm simply doing what I'm told at this point
I hope to understand this on a more intrinsic level soon
but I fear I may embrace it the same way I do cooking
I can follow directions, and deviations are stressful.
